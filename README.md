### 1.What are some examples of fungible tokens compared to non-fungible tokens that you use that are not blockchain related?

**Fungible Tokens**
> Definition: Interchangeable and identical in value.

**Examples:**

1. Currency (e.g., cash)

2. Gift cards

3. Movie tickets (general admission)

4. Commodities (e.g., oil, wheat)

5. Loyalty points

**Non-Fungible Tokens**
> Definition: Unique and not interchangeable.

**Examples:**

1. Real estate (e.g., houses, land)

2. Collectibles (e.g., baseball cards)

3. Assigned seating tickets (e.g., concert tickets)

4. Passports

5. Diplomas

### 2.How much gas did you pay to deploy your contract? What are some implications of the gas auction fees model?

I successfully deployed my smart contract to the Sepolia testnet, and during the deployment, I paid 0.06837925 ETH in gas fees. The total amount of gas used for the transaction was **6,806,221 gas** units.

### 3.Include a link to your contract deployment transaction on https://goerli.etherscan.io/ or similar testnet.

I deployed my smart contract on the Sepolia testnet as Goerli is no longer recommended for use. Below is the link to my deployed contract:

https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0xaf75E28a6D84b59647c356a52483fa4a6Cf8b5d5
